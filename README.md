# Pages
As briefly discussed with Michelle prior to work beginning, it's common
to find instances throughout a project where the design created by the designer
finds itself at odds with its technical implementation; some layouts
aren't as technically viable at others. For this project, on these occasions,
I tried to reduce complexity via slight deviations from the designs provided;
I only did so in the cases where I believed the deviation looked just as
good as the original did. Although I'm sure that I missed a couple, this
is a relatively comprehensive list. Please feel free to reach out with
questions or requests; I'm more than happy to modify or change any
aspect discussed below.

### Home
- No slider (dynamic)

### About /about 
- The original mobile design implements a structurally unique layout
from the original desktop design. To implement both of them as they stand,
it would double the work, because two separate pages of code would
need to be written. Instead, I implemented a mobile design that is
much more similar to the desktop version, and only requires slight
deviations in layout structure.

### Testimonials
- Users can't presently add their own testimonials (dynamic)

### Get One Give One
- For the "Purchase, Plan, Donate, Effect" images, the spacing of the images
is off, so the text is centered beneath them instead of flush with the
left edge as shown in the design.
- In the original design for this page, the testimonials look completely
different than the testimonials do on the actual "Testimonials" page. I took
the design of the testimonials from the other page and implemented them
here to increase consistency.
- Buttons don't have a white border
- To reduce complexity, Giving Partners aren't in a slider

### Help Center (FAQ)
- No search (dynamic)
- I had issues extracting the original splash image from the AI file,
so I used a different one
- Different drop down icons

### Work
- It would be hard to get the original desktop design to look good across
all potential screen widths because of the amount of horizontal content that is
jam-packed into it. Things get a lot easier when you move the form underneath
everything else, and make the layout more vertical (which is what I did).
- No form (dynamic)

### Gift
- I changed the layout of the little pieces of text that have icons next
to them to be more vertical; it reduces technical complexity and makes
them look better across all screens.

### Contact
- The blue background requires a white SOS logo, which wasn't included in the
assets. I also thought the text was incredibly hard to read in the original
design. If the white logo is furnished, then this can easily be changed.
- A basic captcha has been included to prevent bots from spamming the search
form
- As of right now the form is hooked up to my email address, but we can
change that when the site is deployed

### Recent Posts
- Since no posts are actually on the site yet, I reused some random images
from other parts of the site. You can easily swap those out yourselves
after I show you how to manage blog posts.
